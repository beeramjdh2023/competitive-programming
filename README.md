# Competitive Programming

This repository contains my solutions to problems from various online judges and competitive programming platforms, including:

- **Codeforces** – Contest problems and practice sets
- **LeetCode** – Interview-style data structures and algorithms problems
- **CodeChef** – Long challenges, cook-offs, and starters
-  Other platforms like AtCoder, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank

Each solution is implemented in **C++17**, organized by platform and contest/problem name for easy navigation.
